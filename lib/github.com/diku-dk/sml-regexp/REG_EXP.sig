[regexp] is the type of regular expressions.

[fromString s] returns a regular expression by parsing the string s
according to the syntax given for regular expressions below. Raises
(Fail msg) in case s is not a regular expression according to the
syntax below.

[match r s] returns true if the regular expression r matches the
string s according to the description below. Returns false if the
regular expression r does not match the string s.

[extract r s] returns NONE if the regular expression r does not match
the string s. Returns SOME l if the regular expression r matches the
string s; the list l is a list of all substrings in s that is matched
by some regular expression appearing in parentheses in r. Strings in
l appear in the same order as they appear in s. Nested parentheses
are supported, but empty substrings of s that are matched by a
regular expression appearing in a parenthesis in r are not listed in
l.

Grammar for regular expressions (RegExp):

   re ::= re1 "|" re2         re1 or re2
       |  re1 re2             re1 followed by re2
       |  re "*"              re repeated zero or more times
       |  re "+"              re repeated one or more times
       |  re "?"              re zero or one time
       |  "(" re ")"          re
       |  c                   specific character
       |  "\" c               escaped character; c is one of |,*,+,?,(,),[,],$,.,\,t,n,v,f,r
       |  "[" class "]"       character class
       |  "[^" class "]"      negated character class
       |  $                   empty string
       |  .                   any character

   class ::=  c               specific character
          |   "\" c           escaped character; c is one of [,],-,\,t,n,v,f,r
          |   c1 "-" c2       ascii character range
          |                   empty class
          |   class class     composition

Whitespace is significant.  Special characters can be escaped by \.
